# 情人节:送什么给你的爱人

![](img/693d523306c0d290ae150e756963667f.png)

我知道情人节是一件非常痛苦的事情，给你的爱人买礼物是最无聊的浪费时间的事情。不过今年，给她买些你们俩都能享受的礼物吧。我保证你会找到办法让她摆脱接下来的五件物品，否则我会骂你小气，还会为此痛斥你。

现在，到货物上来！

    What chick isn’t going to love a Nintendo DS? There are tons of great remakes of classics she probably grew up on and lots of fun, easy to play games like Brain Age. For a real special moment between you, pick up two DSes and play each other in Mario Kart. Just make sure you lose on purpose though ;)

    Though wine isn’t really related to technology, you’re buying it through a website and it *is* romantic. The infamous Woot.com now has a wine section offering various wines each day for a discounted price. Today’s feature is the Kunde Estate Trio for only $49.99 with $5 for shipping. Why not get some wine, get drunk, pig out, and cuddle during *CSI: Miami*?

    *   **[Heart-shaped USB Drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230322164156/http://www.mobilefun.co.uk/product/12732.htm)**
    Nothing is more geeked out than a USB drive – especially one with a heart. Give her your heart along with a bunch of your favorite love songs on the drive. Just be prepared to buy some flowers too, because this isn’t cutting it, you cheapskate.

    *   **[X and O Bakeware](https://web.archive.org/web/20230322164156/http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/sku8512402/index.cfm?pkey=cvalbkgi&cm%5Fsrc=None&flash=on&cmrf=http%3A//www.slashfood.com/2007/01/29/hearts-xs-and-os-shaped-cakes-for-romantics/)**
    Williams Sonoma may be an overpriced cookware store, but it’s a damn fun one. Pick up some fun new kitchenware and cook with your lovely lady for a change. Try making cookies or small cakes with this X and O mold. Baking not your thing? Freeze some water in these and spice up a cocktail with some lovin’!

    当然，如果你真的是一个缺乏想象力的流浪汉，你可以给她买一件粉红色的摩托罗拉 RAZR 就完事了。
