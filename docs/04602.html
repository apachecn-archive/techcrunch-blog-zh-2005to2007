<p class="translated">Because it only works on unlocked phones, expect M-Buzz to be for our friends across the pond first, with a rollout here sometime next year with carrier endorsement (read: Cingular). There are hints that M-Buzz will be for more than music downloads, but we're not sure exactly what that means. In fact, we're really not sure of much, except what they've given us and what we can piece together with conjecture.</p>
<p class="translated">At any rate, M-Buzz launches on October 2, and when you consider the number of people worldwide who have Sony-Ericsson phones, it could actually be a contender, globally-speaking, of course.</p>
