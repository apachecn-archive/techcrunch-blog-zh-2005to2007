				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated"><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/g wireless, but that's just to connect to the included USB dongle that plugs into your computer.&lt;/root&gt;"/></p>
<p class="translated">The software attaches to Skype as a plugin, then interfaces with the wireless dongle to relay audio back and forth from the phone. The wireless does NOT enable the phone to bypass a computer entirely, which is unfortunate. But the audio quality is quite good, and there is a speakerphone on the back for wireless hands-free usage on the pooper.</p>
<p class="translated">You could even use this to stream music or other audio from your computer, because essentially that's what it's doing when you're making a Skype call. Not great, but somewhat of a condolence prize for this needing a PC to operate.</p>
