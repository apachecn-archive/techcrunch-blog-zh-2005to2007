They thought it would be a nice way to show off their passion for Flash and keep a directory of new web startup logos and basic information.</p> <p>The site proved to be so popular that the two have kept working on it, adding new companies and products (there are nearly 800 now). They’ve also changed the user interface substantially and have added Ajax components to the site. If anything, this is a fun site to just click around on and read about startups.</p> <p>Logos can be sorted by date added or alphabetically. Clicking on a logo brings up basic information at the bottom of the page, and companies can also add their own code (a video, RSS feed, widget, etc.).</p> <p>The site is also taking advertisers for the first time (we are advertising on the site to support this project).

They raised €2.7 million, or about $3.5 million, from Doughty Hanson Technology Ventures.</p> <p>We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/06/11/plazes-gets-traction-at-reboot-70/">first profiled Plazes </a>on June 11, 2005 (the day this blog started). It’s evolved significantly since then, obviously, but the core idea is the same - Plazes tracks your physical location and shows you other Plazes users and places nearby. Plazes also integrates with Skype, has a widget to place on websites that shows your current location and other information, and a SMS service to find out the current location of your Plazes friends.</p> <p>I spoke with founder Felix Petersen earlier this evening. He says Plazes continues to see “strong growth” and has 40,000 active users currently. Those users are “predominantly users from the US (40%), followed by Germany, UK, Netherlands, Canada and Switzerland.” A thousand or so users are online at any given time.</p>  <span> <a class="snap_nopreview" title="Related Blogs &amp; Articles" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.sphere.com/search?q=sphereit:http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/05/european-startup-plazes-raises-e27-million/">Sphere It</a> </span>    				</div> 		  				<p class="postmetadata">Posted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.techcrunch.com/category/company-product-profiles/" title="View all posts in Company &amp; Product Profiles" rel="category tag">Company &amp; Product Profiles</a> |   </p> 		 	</div>                  	        				   			<div class="post" id="post-4769">	  <h3>Vivian Wu </h3>  				 				<div class="entry"> 					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.ta.com/team/team_menlo_park.asp?ID=64"><img src="../Images/ebf156c1dcae0b6ad699434e11171d1b.png" class="shot" alt="" data-original-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011im_/http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/photo_wu.jpg"/></a>If you happened to wander onto the Google campus last Sunday, January 28th, you might not have been surprised to notice a flurry of activity around building 40, even on a Sunday night.  But you would have walked in on an incredible sight.  An entire auditorium filled with hundreds of people mingling around and stopping by colorful booths where friendly and enterprising 12 year girls explained their wares and encouraged you to buy their hand-made sparkling picture frames for $10 or scented soaps for $2. </p> <p>It was the Girls’ Middle School Entrepreneurial Night, hosted by Google.  One after the other, ten teams of 3-5 seventh grade girls presented their Powerpoint on stage to a panel of Silicon Valley judges and an audience of 400 parents, teachers and students.  The students’ goal:  to raise $100-250 from a venture capitalist to fund operations until May.  The judges:  successful entrepreneurs like Diane Greene from VMWare and Christine Comaford-Lynch from Mighty Ventures, and experienced investors from Bay Partners, InterWest, Kleiner Perkins, Versant, and TA Associates.  As many of us asked each other in amazement, how old were you when you made your first presentation to 400 people?  How old were you when you raised money for your first venture?</p> <p>These girls presented with aplomb and humor.  The audience laughed heartily when Grace Kagle, from Bubble Trouble, explained the compelling market opportunity for their scented soaps and bath salts as being “anyone who likes to take baths and be clean.”  The team I funded, One Stop Pet Shop, started with a team jingle and then explained that they picked pet products because they were passionate about pets, they wanted to differentiate from the other teams selling products primarily for girls, and people make purchases for pets as though they’re “an equal family member.”  Hence the 100% margins on the $8 water bowls and $3.50 dog treats that were flying off the booth table!  </p> <p>Of course, nurturing twelve year old entrepreneurship takes more than one evening.  With an army of volunteer business coaches and parents directed by Ann Tardy for the past few years and ably taken over by Tracy Greene this year, GMS’ Entrepreneurial Education program is a full-year course for the seventh grade where the girls spend the first half creating their business ideas, writing 8-10 page business plans and preparing to present on funding night.  These concise plans are complete with business and product descriptions, market opportunity and competitive analysis, management team bios, detailed unit economics and financial projections.  Unique to these business plans (and I’ve seen quite a few in my lifetime!) is the section on Time Management, where the girls detail their time commitments (including homework, commuting and sleep) and calculate how much time they have to devote to their entrepreneurial activities! </p> <p>Worth noting is the fact that the girls are all taught to develop profitable and philanthropic businesses.  In May, they liquidate the businesses, return capital (and more) to investors, and each donate 5-20% of profits to charities like Greenpeace, SPCA, CARE and the school library!  Several of the teams focused on recycled products as well, which Trae Vassalo from Kleiner particularly applauded when she funded Reuse, Recycle and Relax.  Now that the excitement of Entrepreneurial Night is over and the teams are funded, it’s time for the girls to deliver on their promises and present their accomplishments in May.  Good luck to tomorrow’s women entrepreneurs! </p> <p><em>Editor’s Note: I met Vivian Wu on an airplane last week while we were both returning from traveling in Los Angeles.

Hundreds of millions of people around the world will eat junk food, drink beer, and watch the best television advertising all year interrupted periodically with a football game. </p> <p>Six startups (Meebo, Meez, Multiply, Plaxo, RockYou and Technorati) who can’t afford the $2.5 million plus for a thirty second spot during the game got together to produce low-budget “SuperBowl” ads and put them on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=SuperDotComAdsXLI">YouTube</a>. Some of them are pretty entertaining. Others, not so much. We’ve embedded all of them below and have a poll to see which one you like the best.</p> <p>By the way, last year’s real SuperBowl ads are still up on Google Video at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://video.google.com/superbowl.html">video.google.com/superbowl.html</a>. I assume Google will replace those ads with SuperBowl XLI ads tomorrow. Yahoo will also be hosting the actual SuperBowl ads once the games starts at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://video.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Video</a>.</p> <p>My favorite “startup” ad is Technorati, although they cheated by using footage from one of my favorite movies. Plaxo and Meebo are tied for second place.</p> <p>The ads and poll are below, in this order: Meebo, Meez, Multiply, Plaxo, RockYou and Technorati:</p> <p> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/04/superbowl-ads-not-really-from-startups/#more-4757">Read the rest of this entry »</a> </p>  <span> <a class="snap_nopreview" title="Related Blogs &amp; Articles" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.sphere.com/search?q=sphereit:http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/04/superbowl-ads-not-really-from-startups/">Sphere It</a> </span>    				</div> 		  				<p class="postmetadata">Posted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.techcrunch.com/category/company-product-profiles/" title="View all posts in Company &amp; Product Profiles" rel="category tag">Company &amp; Product Profiles</a> |   </p> 		 	</div>                  	        				   			<div class="post" id="post-4748">	  <h3>Michael Arrington </h3>  				 				<div class="entry"> 					<p>The launch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://picnik.com/">Picnik</a> a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://go2web2.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-click-photo-fixing.html">couple of days ago</a> brought us yet another online photo editing tool. Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.fauxto.com/">Fauxto</a>, Picnik uses Flash, whereas most of the earlier editing tools all use Ajax for in-browser editing.</p> <p>Since all computers come with basic software that rotates, resizes and crops photos, there needs to be a compelling reason to use an online service. Uploading a photo to such a service, editing it and then downloading it back to your hard drive too high of a cost. To compensate for this, most services allow you to transfer the edited photos directly to Flickr, Webshots or other online photo services, saving users the trouble of making round trips uploading and downloading. </p> <p>Most of these online services also offer editing tools that go beyond simple rotation, resizing and cropping and start to creep into Photoshop territory. Here’s a few of the better ones, along with our most recent testing notes:</p> <p><big><strong>Fauxto</strong></big></p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.fauxto.com/"><img src="../Images/4151b1396a0d3fc69cc0cd2852299a82.png" class="shot2" alt="" data-original-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011im_/http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/fauxtologos.png"/></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.fauxto.com/">Fauxto</a> is a Flash-based Photoshop look-alike. It is the only layer-based online tool that we know of, and is by far the best of the bunch. But if all you are looking for is photo editing, and you aren’t familiar with Photoshop, Fauxto will frustrate you with its complexity. And if you are already familiar with Photoshop, chances are you have a copy already. Fauxto is lovely to look at and it is a really nice example of Flash in action, but I’m not sure who their target market is.</p> <p><big><strong>Picnik</strong></big></p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.picnik.com/"><img src="../Images/93695f5e7e2ab23c1030f978be56c680.png" class="shot2" alt="" data-original-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011im_/http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/picniklogos.png"/></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a> is the new kid on the block, and they’re the best so far. It is also Flash based, it is the fastest of the bunch and the user interface is the most intuitive. Once you are done editing, you can transfer your photos directly to Flickr. Picnik has replaced Ajax-based PXN8 as our favorite online photo editing tool.</p> <p><big><strong>Picture2Life</strong></big></p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.picture2life.com/"><img src="../Images/5019cc610c7dacddb65ff6aafefb5b2f.png" class="shot2" alt="" data-original-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011im_/http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/picture2lifelogos.png"/></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.picture2life.com/">Picture2life</a> is an Ajax based photo editor. It’s focused on grabbing and editing images that are already online. The tool selection is average, and the user interface is poor. There are some bugs on the site. Photos can be transferred to Flickr, 23 and Imageshack after editing.</p> <p><big><strong>Preloadr</strong></big></p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.preloadr.com/"><img src="../Images/449975130a57203a8f84e900da3762db.png" class="shot2" alt="" data-original-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011im_/http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/preloadrlogos.png"/></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/18/new-stuff-for-flickr-freaks/">Preloadr</a> is a Flickr-specific tool that uses the Flickr API, even for account sign-in. The service includes basic cropping, sharpening, color correction and other tools to enhance images. The fact that Preloadr is designed specifically to work with Flickr may not be an advantage - some of the other services are just as good or better and also offer Flickr integration. </p> <p><big><strong>PXN8</strong></big></p> <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.pxn8.com/"><img src="../Images/bd5b2e6a7ddb0e9eaf2a9dbddd2e5128.png" class="shot2" alt="" data-original-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011im_/http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/pxn8logos.png"/></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205192011/http://www.pxn8.com/">PXN8</a> is the best of the Ajax based editors (and the best overall until Picnik launched) and has a great user interface with the main features highlighted on large icons. The basic “enhance” feature does a very good job of fixing the obvious problems with pictures.
