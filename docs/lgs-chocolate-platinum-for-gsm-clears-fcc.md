![](http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/EDGE successor to the Chocolate, sometimes known as the Chocolate Platinum, just cleared the dreaded and danger-fraught FCC approval process. While we think Platinum Chocolate sounds like an ingredient in Cadbury's Fabergé Creme Eggs, this is one dope slider.</root>)

Looking like a slightly wider, yet cleaner, version of Verizon's Chocolate, the KE800 sports the same touch-sensative and light-up buttons as the Choco. Otherwise, it's upgraded across the board, with 256MB built-in RAM, MP3/AAC support for audio, microSD for expansion, and a 2-megapixel camera. And it has an integrated FM tuner, which makes it a real musicphone.

Other than that, it's a mystery, and we love mysteries. But we do know it's bound to land of one of our US GSM carriers, probably before Xmas, as clearing FCC is one of the very last steps a phone has to take before it ends up in our dirty stocking.
