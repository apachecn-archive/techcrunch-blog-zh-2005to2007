# T-Mobile 最终获得 KRZR

![](https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/AT&T version, including a 2-Megapixel camera and EDGE. The T-Mo version, however, adds stereo Bluetooth. Unlike the Verizon and Sprint versions, there are no external playback buttons. But those weiners only have a 1.3-Megapixel camera anyway, so whatevs!</root>)

Want 3G? Not on this phone. That's just as well, though, as T-Mobile's 3G network is still in the incubator, so if you're looking for a long-term fix, this phone might not be it, no matter how hot it is. It's like that girl at the club, she's miss right now, not miss right. Right? Right.
