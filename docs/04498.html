<p class="translated"><img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/CD drives based on its 12th gen optical storage technology. Three of the drives will supplement the 830 series. The drives will write at 18x DVD±R, which can fill al 4.7GB 16x DVD±R  disc in five minutes. The internal DRU-830A and the external DRX-830U will come bundled with Nero 7 and are compatible with Windows. The DRX-830UL-T has dual compatibility with Mac and Windows and also comes with Roxio Toast 6.&lt;/root&gt;"/></p>
<p class="translated">Finally, the DRX-S50U is basically the same thing as the 830U, but it is intended for use with laptops and features a slimmer design for portability and whatnot. It also includes Nero 7.</p>
<p class="translated">The internal DRU-830A drive is shipping now for about $70 after a $20 mail-in rebate; the external DRX-830U burner is expected to ship in October for around $100 after a $30 mail-in rebate; and the external DRX-830UL-T burner will be available in December for about $120 after a $30 mail-in rebate. The DRX-S50U drive will be available in October for about $130.</p>
<p class="translated">Does anyone actually use rewritable discs anymore? I don't think I've used one since the 90s.</p>
