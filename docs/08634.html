<p class="translated"><img src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/Edelman laptop debacle. Here's what he says:&lt;/root&gt;"/></p>
<blockquote><p class="translated">Think about this: Microsoft dropped about $1500/laptop * 90 laptops + shipping (my rough estimate puts that at a little less than $150,000) to get some positive digital ink. That’s a fairly expensive campaign for the blogosphere, and by comparison if we assume that their boxed Vista product costs them about $20/unit, that same $150,000 could have been spent on seeding Vista to about 7500 bloggers.</p></blockquote>
<p class="translated">So why didn’t they just send boxed product and a nice fruit basket? Well, as Dave wrote, apparently Vista hard to install and has hardware requirements that most “thought leaders” don’t have. Hell, half of them run Macs.</p>
<p class="translated">So there you have it. Microsoft was afraid that Vista would stink up the place. Therefore, they made sure that it came enclosed in a fancy new laptop that could run all of Vista’s graphical pomposity. Clever clever.</p>
