IP-830w 是三星/Sprint 的全球手机。设计用于 CDMA 和 GSM < the IP-830w is a beefy smartphone with a QWERTY keyboard. At $799.99, $499.99 after rebate, you'd better have a huge expense account to pay for this bad boy. However, Sprint's roaming partners in GSM countries as well as some Asian partners make it a bit more compelling. It also runs Windows Mobile, so you can ActiveSync your life away if need be.

Overall, it's a fairly good phone but a bit overwrought in terms of size and price. Consider it if your frequent flyer miles balance is greater than the time you spend with your kids.
