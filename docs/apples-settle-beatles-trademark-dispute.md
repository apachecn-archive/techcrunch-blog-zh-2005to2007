# 苹果解决披头士商标纠纷

Apple Inc., makers of the ubiquitous iPod, and Apple Corps, guardians of Beatles' material, today settled their longstanding trademark feud. The companies have been embroiled in litigation over rights to the name for roughly 20 years.

While there was no official announcement of Beatles availability on iTunes, the end to this debate will no doubt accelerate the procedure. In fact, I'm sure the companies probably settled their differences just to get The Beatles on iTunes. It's the bigger picture or something.

Anyway, we'll keep you posted as this story develops.
