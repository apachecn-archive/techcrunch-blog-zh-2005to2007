<p class="translated"> The bags are made from durable, water-resistant 1000 Denier cordura with heavy foam padding and a plastic shield between the foam and fabric for better protection. A padded shoulder strap is included and there’s an extra handle to make it easier to carry on your shoulders. Plus there’s pockets on the sides for carrying a keyboard, mouse and cables. </p>
<p class="translated"> These would also be great if you’re embarrassed by the way your computer looks to the point where you wouldn’t take it out in public. Kinda like putting a bag on your girlfriend/boyfriend’s head. </p>
<p class="translated"> Disappointingly, I couldn’t find an image larger than what I posted, though I don’t think there’s too much more to see. </p>
