秀后光芒
[菲利普·戈迪克](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://facetiae.blogspot.com/)

我在这里，开始了一周的复习[【2】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/11/takeoffs-and-landings/)
，既然任务很明显，我会做我必须做的事情。你知道我无法控制自己，尽管有些人可能会抱怨，但我会为苹果公司的 iPhone 鼓劲。
另一款全新的超级手机[【4】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/08/ces-2007-first-day-jitters/)
是被牵着走向屠宰场的羔羊，因为我们都已经看到，这一周，乔布斯可以在水上行走[【6】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/11/non-newtonian-and-ferro-fluid/)。
虽然冠名权不明确[【7、](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/bloops-cisco-sues-apple/)[【8】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/cisco-and-apple-made-a-deal-on-the-iphone-name/)
和 2G(不是 3？)一个谜[【9】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/09/nokia-on-iphone-wtf/)
你希望你能在这里[【10】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/09/crunchgear-macworld-2007-the-keynote/)
成为历史的一部分[【11】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/apple-iphone-faq/)[12】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/pogue-blam-play-with-iphone-pee-a-little/)[13】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/apples-iphone-fiction-from-fact/)。本周这位作家还应该谈些什么吗？
哦，对了:
CES。
让我们去找一个苹果不去的地方[【14，](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/apple-tv-hands-on/)
，给一个双向玩家取名为[【16】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/hybrid-blu-ray-hd-dvd-player-coming/)“最佳表演”[【17】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/11/best-in-show-lgs-swinger/)

但是现在，回到 iPhone[【18】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/12/the-futurist-reading-the-apple-tea-leaves-or-what-the-iphone-tells-us-about-the-future/)，这是我们渴望的东西，
让我们登录 cells wapper[【19，](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/11/cellswapper-an-end-to-endless-contracts/)[20】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/10/recycle-your-cellphone-with-recellular/)，因为我们正在切换到 Cingular[【21】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304165454/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/08/wall-street-journal-reports-cingular-scores-iphone-tomorrow/)。
