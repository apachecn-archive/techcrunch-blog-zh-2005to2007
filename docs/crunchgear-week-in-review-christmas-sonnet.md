游戏系统，不择手段
[菲利普·戈迪克](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://facetiae.blogspot.com/)

想要未使用的礼品卡[【1】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/18/better-use-that-best-buy-gift-card-soon/)买不到的游戏？
既然彩票不起作用[【2】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/19/amazon-wii-and-ps3-lottery-results/)，试试这个吧:
本周给我们留下深刻印象的是一起老派的抢劫[【3】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/21/nerdy-felons-steal-190k-in-microchips/)。
所以，去 Flippid[【4】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/18/flippid-matches-gear-with-geeks-free/)找一个间谍装置[【5】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/20/spion-orbitor-electronic-listening-device-for-the-devious/)
一个微型摄像头[【6】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/19/secret-agent-man/)，一个手机瞄准镜[【7】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/18/release-your-inner-peeping-tom-with-a-cellphone-telescope/)
一把沙漠刀[【8】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/18/badassery-gerber-hinderer-rescue-knife/)以防你失去所有希望。
太阳能充电器可能会帮你一个忙。
为了更长时间的等待，一个烟灰缸[【10】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/19/thank-you-for-smokingat-your-desk/)和一个剃须刀[【11】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/18/brando-adds-electric-shaver-to-its-list-of-usb-products/)。一张 TomTom 地图展示你所有的计划。
驾驶室跟踪[【13】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/18/nyc-cabs-getting-tv-and-location-tracking/)帮助拦截送货车。但是如果你不能同步你的手表，你所有精心安排的计划都可能会失败。由于被抓的风险相当大，得到游戏的最好方法很简单:等待[【15】](https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013356/http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/21/discount-ps3s-on-the-horizon-if-youre-ok-with-refurbs/)。

编者按:我们 CrunchGear 认为，我们的读者应该得到的不仅仅是上周公告、谣言、产品发布和评论的乏味摘要。因此，在周一早上，我们请来了菲利普·戈迪克(Philipp Goedicke)来帮助我们撰写提要，以补充布莱斯·德宾(Bryce Durbin)的插图。美国国家公共广播电台每周新闻问答节目“等等，等等…别告诉我！”会认出菲利普的名字是该剧《打油诗挑战》的编剧。他有押韵的天赋，他同意用这种天赋为邪恶创作一首科技诗歌供你欣赏。它是新的和不同的(就像好的技术一样)，我们希望你喜欢它。更多关于戈迪克先生的信息，请查看他的博客 Facetiae。乔希·戈德曼
