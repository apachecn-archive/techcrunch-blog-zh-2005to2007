We like the LG checker keypad thing it's been doing, and the fact that the phone comes wrapped in your choice of leather coverings, complete with pockets and other wallety things.

The phone itself is pretty nice too, using a DMB tuner to pick up that fancy digital TV they have all over Korea. In addition to its 1.3-megapixel camera and MP3 player, the TV has a USB port that exports the DMB video signal live. Meaning you plug it into your PC and watch TV on your display, which would be particularly handy for laptop users.

It's just introduced, so no word yet on pricing, but as it's DMB, don't look for it at your local retailer here in the states. That being said, many features we see in Asia first make their way here rather quickly (remember when people laughed at camera phones?), so "walletphones" might be seen sometime soon.
