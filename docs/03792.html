				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated"><img src="https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/boom mic, this X-Sport BTH-11 gets more range than most Bluetooth headsets, but make you look even more like a spaceman.&lt;/root&gt;"/></p>
<p class="translated">The headset's other features are Bluetooth V1.2 support, 15 hours of talk time, Nokia AC adapter compatibility, and weighs 8.8 grams. The range, which is the selling point, is only useful if you're walking about your house with this on your ear. Otherwise, as far as I know, no automobile is 20 to 30 meters long.</p>
