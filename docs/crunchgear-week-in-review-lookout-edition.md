布雷克认为《商业周刊》的预测过于温和，所以他让我们一瞥它们给 T2 带来的破坏。
但是，嘿，先生，
如果不押注于谷歌[【2】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/26/google-tops-global-branding-list/)和微软的 Vista[【3】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/22/compusa-banks-on-windows-vista-or-money-back-guarantee/)，保守的投资者如何才能保持高位？
既然 Vista 的游戏让人们有理由欢呼[【4】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/23/vista-gaming-10-reasons-it-will-be-hot-5-reasons-were-worried/)
那就让我们现在就得到它吧，尽管它并没有真的退出。
可以换一杯拿铁[【5】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/22/black-market-vista-hits-the-streets-in-china-for-less-than-a-latte/)，也可以弄一杯 pre-0wn3d[【6】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/23/vista-gets-0wn3d/)
或者网上弄[【7】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/24/windows-vista-now-available-from-newegg/)(虽然稍微去骨)。
或者提前订购，免费获得热点
(嗯，九十天，小字领带“免费”起来[【9】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/25/buy-an-iphone-get-15-years-of-free-service/)，你看)。
硬件厂商准备好了，留意[【10】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/24/asus-vista-happy-mobos/)或者 in-[【11】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/22/boot-camp-free-for-leopards-30-for-tigers/)
还有一些软件拒绝过时[【12】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/24/xp-to-live-until-2010/)。

或者也许他们的电话线路配备了谎言。
但如果你寻求我们认可的、有效的新年预测[【15】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/24/blu-ray-to-fail-ps3-bites-back-and-big-tvs-for-cheap-cnet-predicts/)[【16】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301225219/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/26/one-mans-wii-pinion/):
