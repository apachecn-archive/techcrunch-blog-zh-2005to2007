家，香榻
[菲利普·戈迪克](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://facetiae.blogspot.com/)

我们回到家里，解压，
解开一团乱麻[【1，](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/15/ces-2007-two-queens-no-smoking/) [2，](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/?s=dear+diary)[3】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/17/what-we-missed-at-ces-sanyo-stuff/)，
，花些时间猜测
究竟是谁杀了 CES。[【4】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/15/who-killed-ces/)
(我猜:不是乔布斯和他的花招[【5】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/15/have-an-intel-mac-have-five-bucks-ok-you-can-use-80211n/)[6】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/19/be-an-apple-2-dollar-80211n-wifinnaire/)
是另外七个“公子哥儿”和“小妞”[【7】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/17/1-in-8-dudes-would-rather-have-a-gadget-than-a-chick/)。)

而且，山寨 iPhones 已经可以在街上买到了[【8】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/16/fake-iphone-on-ebay/)
所以是时候回家放松一下，踢踢疲惫的双脚了。[【9】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/18/gravity-defyer-shoes-dont-actually-defy-gravity/)
我们会看电视，但是(咒骂)那些 TiVo 广告又回来了[【10】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/16/tivo-fast-foward-ads-theyre-back/)
所以 BluRay 被破解难道不是一件幸事吗？当我们等待《网飞之流》不仅仅是一个计划的时候，我们会看没有广告的节目，并坚持下去。[【15】](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303215237/http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/17/ie-7-reaches-100-million-downloads-firefox-still-on-the-march/)
