All pretty reasonable features for a phone of this size to have, despite its advanced design and the fact that there are no candid shots of it in existence, just mockups.</root>)

Following the link on their page, we find out it's designed by Jaren Goh, the same guy who did the renders for the Sony Ericsson Black Diamond phone that will cost $300,000\. This phone is rumored to be released in November, but he's got a track record of 0, so we won't be holding our breath.
