# 无线视频婴儿监视器无线监控您的宝宝

![](https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/7 surveillance of your infant is with a baby monitor. And, being a gadget lover, you're going to get the most effective, feature-packed one on the market, aren't you?</root>)

That baby monitor might be the wireless BVM we found on BosieBoo. It's a two-part solution, one being a hand held wireless video monitor, the other being the camera and transceiver.

The camera has a tripod for the dresser or a beanbag mount for softer settings, features night vision (!?), and looks like something from "War of the Worlds." It sports a stand-by mode so it's only activated when it hears a noise.

The receiver has a 3.5" LCD screen, connects wirelessly to the broadcast camera, and has AV outs so you can watch your tyke sleep on your HDTV. If only the guys from "Revenge of the Nerds" had one of these stalker-tastic toys.

It's about $215 from BosieBoo in the UK, and is all the help any neglectful parent needs.
