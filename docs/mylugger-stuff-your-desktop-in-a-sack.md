# 米卢格:把你的桌面装进袋子里

![](https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Mac Pros and LCDs, I totally can. Or you can.</root>)

The bags are made from durable, water-resistant 1000 Denier cordura with heavy foam padding and a plastic shield between the foam and fabric for better protection. A padded shoulder strap is included and there’s an extra handle to make it easier to carry on your shoulders. Plus there’s pockets on the sides for carrying a keyboard, mouse and cables.

These would also be great if you’re embarrassed by the way your computer looks to the point where you wouldn’t take it out in public. Kinda like putting a bag on your girlfriend/boyfriend’s head.

Disappointingly, I couldn’t find an image larger than what I posted, though I don’t think there’s too much more to see.
